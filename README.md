# Snapdicto v1.0

 This application eliminates the need to type text in any search engine for a dictionary word meaning.

 Simply scan the word and get it meaning or definition. (FAST)


 # Sample Images of the App

 # To Do: (Part of Our Future Objective)

 Building of an Option-Menu where the user can select his/her Recognition type.(What he wants the app to recognize). i.e. this will affect the application's flow: 

 For example:

  - Dictionary: This retrieves dictionary meaning of the word recognized. (done)

  - Theasaurus: This retrieves suggested words for the recognized word.

  - Weblinks: This will prompt opening up a web-browser of the recognized weblink.

  - Character: This will retrieve Wikipedia information of a recognized character or personnel.

  - ResearchWorks: This will provide a page of summarised research works of a sentence/word recognized.
